* **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps**
* **Explain the behavior you expected to see**
* **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** if possible
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Cookie Confusion Toolkit which the suggestion is related to**
* **Describe the current behavior and explain the behavior you expected to see instead**
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through the 'beginner' and 'help-wanted' issues:

* **Beginner issues** - issues that should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two
* **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues

### Pull Requests

* **Do not include issue numbers in the PR title**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible**
* **Follow the Python style guides**
* **Document new code**
* **Create feature branches**
* **One pull request per feature**

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing CI build
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üîß `:wrench:` when updating configs

### Python Styleguide

All Python code should adhere to PEP 8 and be linted using flake8. Use type hints whenever possible, and document functions using Google-style docstrings.

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use Markdown
* Reference functions with backticks: `function_name()`
* Use code blocks when providing example code
* Document all public functions with docstrings

## Ethical Guidelines

When contributing to the Cookie Confusion Toolkit, please follow these ethical guidelines:

1. **Only contribute features for legitimate security testing and research**
   - All contributions should have a clear defensive purpose
   - Avoid functionality that can only be used for exploitation without security benefits

2. **Respect responsible disclosure principles**
   - Do not include exploits for undisclosed vulnerabilities
   - If your contribution reveals a new vulnerability class, follow responsible disclosure

3. **Consider the ethical implications of new features**
   - Could this feature be easily misused?
   - Does it include sufficient safeguards and documentation?

4. **Security comes first**
   - Reports of security issues in the tool itself should be handled with priority
   - When in doubt, err on the side of caution

## Governance
